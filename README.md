# Maze-Generator

### Eductional Project  
This project generates a random maze of a selected size and visualises the process. I started this project to graps some of the algorithms used for maze generation and visualise the steps an algorithm takes. Currently only Prim's Algorithm is implemented.

## Demo

#### Project Aims:
- Understand and implement a maze generation.
- Work on effective commenting.

#### What I Learned:
- The general method of maze generation.
- Prim's Algorithm.

In future, I aim to increase the number of algorithms in this implementation as alternatives to Prim's Algorithm. I could also extend this project to create a playable maze game. As this project was mostly about the visualisation aspect, the effeciency of the generation wasn't as important but with a game I could look into adding multithreading to this project to increase the speed of generation.

### How to use:

Run mazeGenerator.py to begin maze generation. Optional arguments include a size one length of the maze, as well as a boolean value that determines whether details of generation are to be displayed to console. If set to false, a progress bar will be displayed instead.  
Size defaults to 50 (50x50 maze).  
Display details defaults to false.
